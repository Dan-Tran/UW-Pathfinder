# UW Pathfinder

This is a simple application that allows you to find the shortest path from one building to another on the University of Washington Campus. This project is organized into three parts, all found under the `src` directory:

* graphStructures: The data structures used to represent the campus pathways and locations.
* cli: A command line program that prints out directions to follow the shortest path from building to building.
* gui: A graphical user interface for `cli` that shows a map of the campus and the shortest path from building to building.

Each component besides `gui` also comes with a test suite that tests each component to make sure all of its behaviors perform correctly.

## Building

This project was built using Eclipse Neon.  Simply choose the `UW Pathfinder` directory under Open Projects from File System to load the project in Eclipse.
